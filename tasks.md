## Performance Benchmarks with This Approach:

| Traditional Development       | AI-Accelerated + MapStruct      |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 8-12 weeks                    | **2-3 weeks**                   |
| Manual mapping (slow runtime) | **MapStruct (10-20x faster)**   |
| Manual testing                | **AI-generated test suites**    |
| Manual documentation          | **Auto-generated OpenAPI docs** |

## Success Tips:

1. **Prepare detailed AI prompts** - More context = better code
2. **Review all generated code** - AI is fast but needs human oversight
3. **Test immediately** - Don't let generated code accumulate without testing
4. **Use Git branches** - Keep generated code organized
5. **Iterate quickly** - If AI code doesn't work, regenerate with better prompts

This plan leverages AI to handle 70-80% of boilerplate code while you focus on business logic,
configuration, and testing!
